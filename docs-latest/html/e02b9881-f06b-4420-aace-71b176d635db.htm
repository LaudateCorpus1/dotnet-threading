          This breaking changes policy is only enforced for libraries which explicitly state it as their governing
          policy. In certain cases, a library governed by this breaking changes policy may depend on a library which is
          not governed by the same policy, or which does not provide any breaking changes policy. In those cases, a
          best-effort is provided to ensure changes to the dependency do not affect dependent code. For maximum
          long-term compatibility, dependent applications and libraries should treat dependencies not governed by this
          policy in accordance with the rules described for preliminary features, even though they are not marked as
          such within the documentation.

              strict than this library, and is not anticipated to be the source of any breaking binary or source

          Major and minor releases do not preserve binary compatibility. For dependent assemblies which use a strong
          name, the binary incompatibility is enforced by a change to the strong name of the assembly. Major and minor
          releases update the value of the
          <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/zb298d28" target="_blank">AssemblyVersionAttribute</a> attribute, which
          always changes the strong name of the assembly.
        </p><p>
          Minor releases are typically used for the promotion of features previously marked preliminary to stable
          features of the API.
        </p><p>
          Major releases are required for any change which breaks backwards compatibility with assembly binding
          redirection, but are typically used for substantial refactoring or other alterations in order to meet the
          needs of a broader user base, or for the purpose of improving overall usability or flexibility of the library.

              For this library, minor releases include a special provision for binary compatibility when using assembly
              binding redirection. For any two versions <span class="literal">x</span> and <span class="literal">y</span> of the library
              where the major version of <span class="literal">x</span> and <span class="literal">y</span> are the same but the minor

              Patch releases never change the strong name of the assembly. This means a patch release updates the

              Patch releases may only add elements to the public API of the assembly if they are marked preliminary.
              This rule ensures that patch releases preserve symmetric binary compatibility for applications and
              libraries which avoid the use of any feature marked as preliminary.

              In some cases, a release will only update the "revision" part of the version. With regard to this breaking
              changes policy, these releases are equivalent to patch releases. In practice, revision-only releases are
              typically reserved for correcting a previous patch or revision release which violated the breaking changes
              policy, or for correcting a bug which was introduced in the current patch cycle without making changes to
              the public API of the assembly.

              Since minor releases result in a change to the strong name of the assembly, binary compatibility by simply
              replacing assemblies on disk is never preserved for strong-named applications or libraries which reference
              the assembly. However, for all stable features, minor releases are binary compatible with previous
              releases when applications are configured with an assembly binding redirection in their configuration.

              To minimize the cost of updating an application to use a new minor release of the library,
              source-incompatible changes should only be introduced when necessary to support a substantial improvement
              to the library. Eligible improvements include but are not limited to resource utilization, runtime
              performance, or new feature offerings.

              Restricting the introduction of features in a patch release to preliminary features provides applications
              the ability to leverage symmetric binary compatibility for maximum runtime reliability, by avoiding the
              use of any feature which is marked as preliminary.

              Assembly binding redirection is only required for compatible assemblies which have different strong names.
              The binary compatibility requirement for patch releases guarantees that these releases will have the same
              strong name, so assembly binding redirection is unnecessary.

              Changes to preliminary features may result in source code incompatibilities due to situations including
              but not limited to conflicts due to ambiguous names. In addition, changing the name of a required
              parameter for the purpose of correcting a spelling error or avoiding confusion is generally allowed due to
              a very low risk of actually causing compilation problems for users. Changes to the names of optional
              parameters, on the other hand, should be avoided whenever possible as users are likely to be referencing
              them directly by name.

          This library may include types and/or members which are designated as preliminary features. The preliminary
          feature designation is indicated by a clear note at the top of the associated documentation page. In the
          library source code, preliminary features are indicated by including the
          <span class="code">&lt;preliminary/&gt;</span> element to the XML documentation comment for the feature. While
          preliminary features are much more "flexible" during the release cycle of the library, certain rules do apply
          in order to ensure the stronger rules provided for stable features will not be violated by a change to a
          preliminary feature. The following list includes examples of these rules, but other rules may be imposed by
          basic logical constraints. The API elements referred to in the following list are assumed to be restricted to
          the publicly-exposed API of the library. The terms "member" and "members" refer to any method, property, or
          event.

              A class may only include a preliminary <span class="code">abstract</span> member if either it is also
              marked preliminary, or all constructors for the class are marked <span class="code">internal</span>. This
              restriction also applies to <span class="code">abstract</span> classes which do not implement an
              <span class="code">abstract</span> member declared in a base class.
